History of changes made to the code for evolver.
Probably missed some changes, can't remember the dates exactly,
most of this was written late at night with a deadline fast approaching!

Damian Murphy (murf),
March 2003.

v0.7.1
Fix initial start city. All functions changed to reflect this.

v0.7
Renamed mutation to inversion. Implemented swap- and point- mutation.

v0.6
GaPlots created.

v0.2.6.1
Old code, forked and brought more up to date to check cyclic behaviour.
Abandoned again when i realise it's just doing a semi-random walk throught the search space.

v0.5.3
No CleanUp. Gives invalid tours a poor fitness.
If a same city is reached again in a tour, add double the distance to the fitness.

v0.5.2
No CleanUp. Gives invalid tours a fitness of MAX_DOUBLE instead.
GA seems to spend all it's time in the wilderness, never getting a valid tour. Chromosomes seem to
homogenise also... why?


v0.5.1
10 Feb 2002
Round-trip TSP with CleanUp. Mutation is an inversion operator.
Single-point crossover.

v0.5
Feb 2002?
non-round trip TSP.

v0.4
Jan/Feb 2002?
Added code to track the ages of individuals.
Doesn't seem to work too well, abandoned again.
Improved all functions again - esp. cleanup & inversion - problems here!
Added code to allow selection of operators & whether to use swing window.
These must be specified by consts at compile time.
will do for now.

v0.3
Jan 2002?
Added no_crossover() function, to transfer parents & children into nex_gen array in correct positions.
This was (and is) done by the crossover() function.
Now we can skip crossover if we wish!
Added code to print best_so_far in numerical order & get length to make it easier to check for errors.
Fixed cleanup, mutation...

v0.2
Jan 20002?
Getting to a solution!
Now doing TSPLIB berlin52 problem.
fitness function changed to reflect this. Now getting distances.
CleanUp introduced.
TSPReader.java created.


v0.1.9
20th Dec 2002
Implemented mutation as the inversion operator - takes a subset of the tour and reverses it.
Parameters for rates, popsize, etc. on command-line.
Created Display.java - a java swing window showing what's happening.

v0.1
Early Dec. 2002. 18th?
First version.
No mutation implemented.
Not doing TSP yet.
Tries to get max( sum genes ) -> e.g. 10 cities, so max is 10*9 = 90, i.e. 9:9:9:9:9:9:9:9:9:9 = chromosome.
